**Title:** I made a workspace manager for people who use CLI agents (Claude, Codex, Gemini) all day

**Tag:** Showcase

---

**Body:**

If you're someone who spends most of your day running AI agents in the terminal - this might be for you.

I found myself constantly juggling multiple terminal windows, switching between projects, and losing track of which agent was working on what. So I built a simple workspace manager specifically designed around CLI-based AI workflows.

**Who this is for:**

- You use Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, or similar tools daily
- You often run multiple agents in parallel on different tasks
- You switch between several projects throughout the day
- You want your agent sessions to persist without manually managing terminal windows

**What it does:**

- **Multi-agent view** - Run 2-3 agents side by side with auto-splitting panes. Give each one a different task and watch them work in parallel.
- **Persistent workspaces** - Your agents stay exactly where you left them when switching projects. Even after restarting the app, everything is preserved.
- **Quick launcher** - Press `1` for Claude, `2` for Codex, `3` for Gemini. Start a new session or resume a previous one with a single keystroke.
- **Workspace organization** - Group your projects into workspaces. Select a project and all your agents automatically switch to that directory.

**My typical workflow:**

1. Select a workspace (e.g., "side-project")
2. Spawn 2-3 agents with `+`
3. Ask Agent 1 to refactor the auth system
4. Ask Agent 2 to write tests
5. Ask Agent 3 to update documentation
6. Switch to another workspace when needed - agents are preserved
7. Come back later and resume right where I left off

**It's intentionally minimal** - no file explorer, no code editor, no bells and whistles. Just terminals and the tools to manage them efficiently.

Built with Swift/SwiftUI for macOS. Native app, lightweight, and fast.

Would love to hear your feedback or feature suggestions!
